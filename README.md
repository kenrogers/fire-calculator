# SimpleFIRE

The world's simplest financial independence calculator.

SimpleFIRE was built with TypeScript, Next, Tailwind CSS, and Jest + React Testing Library for testing.

## Philosophy

SimpleFIRE was built as a quick, simple way to get a picture on what it will take to become financially independent by a certain age.

This simple version assumes all your assets are in Vanguard's VTSAX fund. It uses the model for financial independence recommended by JL Collins in his book, [The Simple Path to Wealth](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Path-Wealth-financial-independence/dp/1533667926).

## Usage

To run, clone the project and `npm install`.

Then run the development server with `npm run dev`.

To test, run `npm run test`.
